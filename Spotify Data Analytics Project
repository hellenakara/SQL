# Throughout this project, I perform SQL data analytic techniques on Spotify Data. 
# The Spotify Data is downloaded from Kaggle to Excel, then input into a table on SQLite Studio RDBMS.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

# After creating the table, I imported the excel data into the RDBMS before beginning some analytic questions.

#1. Pull up all of the data from the Spotify Table.
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#2. Determine the most popular track limiting the query to the top ten tracks.
SELECT artist_name, popularity, track_name
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY track_name
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 10;
    
#3. Determine the duration of each song.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms, tempo
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY duration_ms desc;

#4. Determine the average duration of each song.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(duration_ms)
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY track_name;
    
#5. Determine the average popularity, danceability, energy, and liveliness by artist and track name.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(liveliness)
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
  
#6. How many songs by Oliva Rodrigo are on the Spotify Playlist? What were the song titiles and popularity rating of each song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    WHERE artist_name like '%Olivia Rodrigo%'
    GROUP BY track_name;
